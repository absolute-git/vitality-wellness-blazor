                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Vitality Wellness Center was founded with a simple mission: to provide comprehensive, personalized care that addresses the whole person - body, mind, and spirit. What started as a small physical therapy practice has grown into a full-service wellness center serving our community.</p>
                <p>We believe that true health goes beyond treating symptoms. Our integrative approach combines the latest in physical therapy and rehabilitation with fitness training, massage therapy, and mind-body practices to help you not just recover, but thrive.</p>
                <p>Every member of our team shares a passion for helping others achieve their health goals. Whether you're recovering from an injury, training for a marathon, or simply want to feel better in your daily life, we're here to support you every step of the way.</p>
